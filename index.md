## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Lachlan-MacLean/folio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
Flies can be a real nuisance, especially to those living in the outback. Moreover, getting rid of them can be an absolute nightmare. That's why this article will explore various methods of modelling the motion of these pesky creatures, and hopefully analyze of the best fly-disposal method. We shall accomplish this by using the mathematical tools associated with linear algebra and vector calculus. This article will be divided into three main sections: Part One, Part Two, and Part 3, followed by a summary of the results. In addition, each section will contain various interactive examples that the reader may benefit from using.
