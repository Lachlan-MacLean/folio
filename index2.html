Moreover, getting rid of them can be an absolute nightmare. That's why this article will explore various methods of modelling the motion of these pesky creatures. The various models shall be derived by using the mathematical tools associated with linear algebra and vector calculus. This article will be divided into three main sections: Part One, Part Two, and Part 3, followed by a summary of the results. In addition, each section will contain various interactive examples that the reader may benefit from using. Equations that are preceded by an asterisk (*) can be hovered over to reveal additional information.<p>First it is important to outline some basic assumptions that were made during the investigation:<br><br><br>-	The effects and any potential health risks associated with these methods will not be considered.<br><br>-	The flies have extremely limited forms of consciousness, and thus are not considered sentient. Likewise, the ethical implications associated with insect-disposal will not be discussed.<br><br>-	The analysis will assume that the environment is the average rectangular room with dimensions: 4.5m x 4m x 2.5m<br><br>- The average fly velocity is approximately 7km/h (about 2m/s) and the maximum reasonable velocity will be set at 10km/h (about 2.7m/s).<br><br>- The person/people shall be described as ellipsoids. This serves as both a useful simplification, and is more representative of a 'zone of irritation'.<br><br><h1 id=p1 class=section>Part One</h1><p>One of the most important steps in the analysis is exploring various potential models. This first section explores how one may use the tools learnt in elementary linear algebra to describe the motion of flies. The resulting linear parametric equations can then be used to calculate any intersections and other values of interest.<p>Assuming two flies A & B with initial positions & initial velocities given by the following vector equations:<h2 class=Math>\( \vec{S}_A = \begin{pmatrix} a\\ b\\ c \end{pmatrix}\lambda \quad\text{and}\quad \vec{S}_B = \begin{pmatrix} g\\ h\\ i \end{pmatrix} \)</h2><p><h2 class=Math>\( \vec{V}_A = \begin{pmatrix} d\\ e\\ f \end{pmatrix}\lambda \quad\text{and}\quad \vec{V}_B = \begin{pmatrix} j\\ k\\ l \end{pmatrix} \)</h2><p class=fignum>(1.0)<p>Where \(\lambda\) represents the scaling parameter corresponding to time. Therefore, each fly may be described by the following vector equations:<p class=Math>\(Fly \quad A = \begin{pmatrix} a\\b\\c \end{pmatrix}\lambda + \vec{p_1} \quad \quad Fly \quad B = \begin{pmatrix} d\\e\\f \end{pmatrix}\lambda + \vec{p_2}\)<p>Or in a more compact form:<p class=Math>\(\vec{A}=\vec{V_1}\lambda+\vec{P_1}\)<br>\(\vec{B}=\vec{V_2}\lambda+\vec{P_2}\)<p class=fignum>(1.1)<p>Writing the equations using the 'compact' notion mostly serves to save time, however it does aid in reducing the complexity of the equations that follow. Particularly, by using these equations, one may describe any potential intersections with people or other objects in the room. Moreover, the velocity can be derived very easily by calculating the magnitude of the velocity vector as shown:<p class=Math>\(||\vec{V_1}||=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\)<br><br>\(||\vec{V_2}||=\sqrt{d^2+e^2+f^2}\)<p class=fignum>(1.2)<p>Thus, using basic physics, one may calculate the time taken for either fly to travel an arbitrary distance. However, knowing the magnitude of the velocity alone does not allow one to calculate an intersection. Instead, by solving for the the intersection of the Fly and the Human, one may obtain the total time, distance, and point of intersection.<p>Since the volume occupied by the Human is described by an ellipsoid, we may begin by starting with the general case given by a sphere and a line.<p>And the human volume is described with the implicit equation:<p class=Math>\(ax^2+by^2+cz^2=1\)<p>Notice that this equation essentially describes all points that have a distance of one unit from the origin. Therefore, it seems appropriate that the intersection may be described as the point at which the fly is one unit away from the origin. If the person remains fixed at the origin, then the equation for distance is simply the magnitude of the fly's position vector (think of a point and it's distance from the origin). Or in the case of Fly A:<p class=Math>\(1=||\vec{A}||=\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2+A_z^2}\)<p>However, this equation is not the easiest to deal with, nor is it the most elegant, especially after substituting the full equations for the path. Instead, it's actually possible to rewrite the above equation using dot-products as:<p class=Math>\(\sqrt{A_xA_x+A_yA_y+A_zA_z}=\sqrt{A \cdot A}\)<p>Though in full, the equation should be a function of \(\lambda\):<p class=Math>\(\sqrt{(\vec{V_1}\lambda+\vec{P_1}) \cdot (\vec{V_1}\lambda+\vec{P_1})}=1\)<p>Although these are vectors, it's possible to use the general binomial expansion:<p class=Math>\((ax+b)^2=a^2x^2+2abx+b^2\)<p class=Math>\(\therefore 1=(\vec{V_1})^2\lambda^2+2(\vec{V_1})(\vec{P_1})\lambda+(\vec{P_1})^2\)<p>To solve the resulting quadratic equation, one may rewrite the coefficients and substitute into the quadratic equation.<div class=tooltip2><p class=MathB>\(x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\quad *\)<div class=right2><p class=Math>\(a=\vec{V_1} \cdot \vec{V_1}\)<p class=Math>\(b=2\vec{V_1} \cdot \vec{P_1}\)<p class=Math>\(c=\vec{P_1} \cdot \vec{P_1}\)</p><i></i></div></div><p>Having derived an equation for the intersection of a fly and a person, it's time to proceed with an example.

The yellow and green lines represent flies A & B respectively, and the person is shown as an ellipse. A door has been added to the graph to aid in improving realism.

Preliminary investigations of these complex solutions yielded the hypothesis that such values describe potential trajectory-corrections the fly could make to achieve a collision. And though the exact physical interpretation of such is beyond this report, it may serve to useful to explore this solution in a more detailed manner if possible.<p>It's also important to mention that since these lines are technically ‘skew’, it might be more appropriate (in some cases) to make use of the formula describing the distance between two lines. However, this formula does not serve well when considering a single parameter (in this case time), as it would yield the closest approach without regard to time. Though this may be more useful if one is defining an area in which both flies will fly though – such as a spray.<h1 id=p3 class=section>Part Three</h1><p>From an intuitive perspective, it’s relatively easy to see that describing the motion of flies with linear equations is rather inaccurate. As such, the previous linear model serves as a good introduction to the method; however, it lacks the complexity and nuance required to accurately describe more realistic motion. For example, the model fails to describe the fly's interactions with walls. In order to construct a more advanced model, and ultimately describe the fly-spray, one would need to replicate the flightpaths of flies more accurately; not what results from describing them with linear equations.<p>One method of describing these paths is to use Bezier curves. The main advantage of using such curves stems from their ability to describe non-linear paths in a predictable and simple fashion. Another key advantage is their generality; a Bezier curve may be extended to 3-dimensional spaces or even 4+ dimensional spaces.<p class=Math>\(x(t)=(1-t)^3P_1+3(1-t)^2tP_2+3(1-t)^2t^2P_3+t^3P_4\)<p class=Math>\(y(t)=(1-t)^3P_1+3(1-t)^2tP_2+3(1-t)^2t^2P_3+t^3P_4\)<p class=Math>\(z(t)=(1-t)^3P_1+3(1-t)^2tP_2+3(1-t)^2t^2P_3+t^3P_4\)<p class=fignum>(3.0)<p>Since Bezier curves are essentially polynomials, it’s important to define the degree of the curve, and the controls points. Intuitively, a higher degree curve may result in more realistic and detailed fly-motion, however the complexity of the polynomials quickly grows beyond reasonable levels. Thus, another useful aspect of defining the paths like such is the ability to ‘stich’ multiple curves together. Specifically, by generating a series of random (pseudo-random) control points, a seemingly random and reasonably realistic path may be generated.<p><p>As an example, the density of fly spray, and the fly's path may be visualized as shown in the graph below. Dark green areas indicate a higher concentration of fly-spray. For the sake of simplicity the curves have only been defined for 2-dimensions in this example.</p><img src=test.png style=object-fit:cover><p class=Math>\(\vec{r_1}(t)=\begin{pmatrix} 3 t^{3} \\ 3 t^{3} + 5 t^{2} (3 - 3 t) + 3 t (1 - t)^{2} \end{pmatrix}\)<p class=Math>\(\vec{r_2}(t)=\begin{pmatrix} t^{3} + t^{2}(3 - 3 t) + 18 t (1 - t)^{2} + 3 (1 - t)^{3} \\ 2 t^{2} (3 - 3 t) + 3 t (1 - t)^{2} + 3 (1 - t)^{3} \end{pmatrix}\)<p class=fignum>(3.1)<p>Here the two Bezier curves \(r_1\) & \(r_2\), represented in orange and red respectively, have been 'stitched' together to form a longer and more detailed curve. The distribution of the spray, however unrealistic, was derived from the Guassian distribution:<p class=Math>\(D(x,y)=e^{-((x-2)^2+(y-2)^2)}\)<p>Using this formulation allows one to calculate the quantity of fly-spray absorbed by a fly traveling along a path. Traditionally, this can be thought of as a line-integral over a scaler-field. However, the full derivation for this is beyond the scope of this article.<p>Below is a graph of an example Bezier curve that the fly could follow from the door.</p><iframe class=des height=500 src=https://www.math3d.org/iWnxTiKSx width=500></iframe><h1 id=p4 class=section>Conclusion</h1><p>In parts one & two the motion of the flies was described as a set of linear vector equations. This had the advantage of being relatively simple to construct and manipulate. The main issue stemmed from the inconsistencies between the modelled fly-paths and that of a real fly; flies do not fly in perfectly straight lines. Thus, part three introduced a well-known mathematical tool known as Bezier curves. These curves are able to describe more intricate and realistic motion where the linear model fails. Moreover, the density of the fly-spray was modelled as a scaler-function in 3d. This allows one to calculate the accumulation of ‘fly poison’, and hence the likelihood of the flies dying.<p>Overall, the models discussed here are just a sample of what’s possible. For example, one may increase the accuracy of the motion by considering a ‘random walk’ process. The primary benefit of using random walk is that it preserves the ‘chaotic’ motion of the flies. One could then combine this with the spray-density model to achieve a better model. Another possibility lays in the use of machine-learning to optimize the distribution of spray given a particular starting volume. This would have the benefit of reducing spray-usage, and possibly killing the flies faster. Given more time, these ideas could’ve been examined further. However, this article has demonstrated several basic methods of describing the motion of flies, and hopefully presents the basis for more complex models.<p></p><br><br><h1 id="Useful References" class="section">Useful Resources</h1><p><a href=https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/how-fast-can-a-housefly-fly/ >1. https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/how-fast-can-a-housefly-fly/</a> <a href=https://www.math3d.org>2. https://www.math3d.org</a> <a href=https://desmos.com>3. https://desmos.com</a></div>
